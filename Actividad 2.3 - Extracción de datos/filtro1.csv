Parts of the neighborhood are landmarked so the remarkable late-19th-century feel of this area will be preserved. That means you can expect to see rows of gracious brownstone homes on tree-lined streets, lots of open sky (the buildings aren't more than four or five stories high), and historic buildings including churches and a small, old-fashioned community library.<br /><br />In the past decade, the area has become a haven for artists and young families.<br /><br />History:<br />Long a bastion of New York City’s African American community, Bed-Stuy, like Harlem, has had a mixed population of homeowners and renters.

I'm told I'm generous. I work well with others. I'm a good talker. I'm a good listener. 
My greatest joy is drawing and painting. And I love designing things. Cars, houses, alarm clocks, locomotives, shoes, chairs, lawn mowers, book covers, etc., etc. I've been into design since I was 8 or 9 years old. 
   I do believe in a higher power, and though I'm devoted, I'm not religious. What I look for in a friend is honesty, kindness, humor, and curiosity. I love people. They're my favorite mammal. Well, next to my cat, Phred.
  I enjoy hosting and am fairly good at it. I keep a tidy home, but when expecting a guest, I take the opportunity to fine tune my home. It's a chance to take care of those little chores that have been getting put off.  
   I like to travel. I enjoyed backpacking and youth hostels in my 20's and small elegant hotels as an adult. Or, on occasion, renting a house, as I did in Rome and Venice,  My favorite destinations have been Tokyo, Rome, Aspen and Berlin. 
   I love science fiction, interior design, cocktail parties, vintage cars, and fine menswear. I'm currently reading ""Save the Cat"", a book on screenwriting, and ""The Professor and the Madman"", a tale of murder, insanity, and the making of the Oxford English Dictionary.  My favorite movie: 2001, A Space Odysey. Show: Caberet. Music: Modern Jazz. Food: Seafood Gumbo.  
   As an Airbnb host, my intention is to create a customized experience for my guest. This can be a quiet, book lined sanctuary, a lively Manhattan pad, or anything in between.  When I ask how was your day, it is because I am sincerely interested. I know that, for some, being away from home can be disorienting. So it's important for me that I be there for you if needed, or remain unobtrusive  if you'd prefer.
If I have a goal, it's that every space I occupy throughout my life be improved by my having been there.

I’m originally from New York( my favorite city in the world), moved to Miami recently so my son can start JHS in warm weather. I work remote so why not by the beach:) 
I’ve always loved meeting new people, hosting gatherings for my friends & family, cooking, serving, cleaning, making sure everyone is cozy & spoiled in my home. Sleepovers were always my thing!! 
When I discovered the Airbnb community I felt like I found my calling. My guest are everything to me. It’s an absolute pleasure to be your Airbnb host!

I come from a huge family, I know entertainment, safety & peace of mind is very important, especially when traveling with kids.. My homes are all in safe neighborhoods & also centrally located for your convenience, so you have everything you need close by. From shops, restaurants, markets & entertainment, you’ll have it all!  

I hope you consider giving me a chance to be your host on your next adventure :)

I’ve always loved meeting new people, hosting gatherings for my friends & family, cooking, serving, cleaning, making sure everyone is cozy & spoiled in my home. Sleepovers were always my thing!! 
When I discovered the Airbnb community I felt like I found my calling. My guest are everything to me. It’s an absolute pleasure to be your Airbnb host!

I come from a huge family, I know entertainment, safety & peace of mind is very important, especially when traveling with kids.. My homes are all in safe neighborhoods & also centrally located for your convenience, so you have everything you need close by. From shops, restaurants, markets & entertainment, you’ll have it all!
